Last weekend,while scrolling twitter I saw the post about Google CTF. Of course I am not qualified to solve it, I clearly do not have much needed experience with such competitions and programming as a whole. After checking it out I stumbled upon an ["Google CTF begginers quest"](https://capturetheflag.withgoogle.com/beginners-quest "CTF") and tasks here looked like they were not that hard.

GoodPassword
```
which took me to the page with the flag:
